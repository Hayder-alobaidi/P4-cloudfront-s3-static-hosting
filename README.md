# Global Static Website Hosting and Advanced Content Delivery with AWS CloudFront

This project demonstrates how to host a fully functional global static website on AWS using S3, CloudFront, and other AWS services for performance optimization, security, serverless edge computing, and real-time content delivery.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will set up a global static website using Amazon Web Services (AWS), utilizing S3 for static content storage and CloudFront as the Content Delivery Network (CDN) to deliver content with low latency. Additionally, AWS services like Lambda@Edge, WAF, Shield, ACM, Route 53, and others will be integrated to enhance performance, security, scalability, and flexibility.

### Technologies Used

- **Amazon S3**: Static website hosting and storage.
- **Amazon CloudFront**: Global CDN for fast content delivery.
- **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**: SSL/TLS certificate for secure connections.
- **Amazon Route 53**: DNS management for custom domain setup.
- **AWS WAF**: Web Application Firewall for security.
- **AWS Shield**: DDoS protection.
- **Lambda@Edge**: Edge computing for content customization and authentication.
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Accelerated API delivery.
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitoring and metrics.
- **Amazon Kinesis**: Real-time logging and analytics.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Static Website Hosting with S3 & CloudFront
- Set up static website hosting in an S3 bucket.
- Create a CloudFront distribution to deliver content globally.
- Configure a custom domain via Route 53.
- Enable SSL/TLS with ACM for secure delivery.

### Phase 2: Performance Optimization
- Configure TTL (Time-to-Live) for caching, optimize TCP performance with QUIC, and set up edge locations for dynamic content.

### Phase 3: Advanced Security Features
- Implement HTTPS, AWS WAF, Shield, signed URLs, ACLs, and field-level encryption for securing the website.

### Phase 4: Edge Computing & Serverless
- Leverage Lambda@Edge for serverless functions that execute at CloudFront edge locations.

### Phase 5: Caching & Content Management
- Implement fine-grained caching strategies, dynamic content caching, and origin failover for high availability.

### Phase 6: Origin & Content Sources
- Configure multiple origins (e.g., S3, EC2) and origin groups for failover and load balancing.

### Phase 7: Logging & Analytics
- Set up access logs, CloudWatch metrics, and real-time logging with Kinesis for performance monitoring.

### Phase 8: Customization
- Customize error pages, enable geo-targeting, and support language detection for personalized content delivery.

### Phase 9: Advanced Protocol Support
- Enable HTTP/2, IPv6, and QUIC (HTTP/3) for improved accessibility and performance.

### Phase 10: Cost Optimization
- Optimize costs using CloudFront price classes and implement GZIP/Brotli compression for request/response payloads.

### Phase 11: Video & Media Delivery
- Configure media streaming protocols like HLS and MPEG-DASH for high-quality video content delivery.

### Phase 12: API Gateway Integration
- Use CloudFront to accelerate RESTful API calls via Amazon API Gateway.

### Phase 13: Real-Time Content Delivery
- Enable instant cache invalidation to ensure content is always fresh.

### Phase 14: Regional Edge Caches
- Configure regional edge caching to reduce load on origin servers and improve content delivery latency.
